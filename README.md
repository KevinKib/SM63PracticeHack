# SM63PracticeHack

The Super Mario 63 Practice Hack revolves around the command shell, which can be opened by pressing ```/``` or ```numpad /```.

## Commands

Check out the commands documentation [there](https://github.com/Sekanor/SM63PracticeHack/blob/master/docs/Commands.md)!

## KoopaShell

The KoopaShell console written by Jhynjhiruu is fully included. It allows to modify pretty much every variable of the game.
The documentation of the KoopaShell module is available [here](https://github.com/Sekanor/SM63PracticeHack/blob/master/docs/KoopaShell.md).
